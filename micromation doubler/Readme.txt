These files are for a Micromation Doubler floppy controller with serial interface.  I have NOT TESTED
THIS BOARD, so the files may or may not be correct.

The 74S287 and 74S471 PROM dumps were completed on 6/28/2021 using an Arduino with a boardboard shield.

The 2708 dump was completed on 6/28/2021 using a Martin Eberhard ME-2700 EPROM programmer/reader.  It
is labeled F8 C.2 (a white label underneath the green one in the photo).  The contents of this EPROM
do NOT match the listing near the end of http://bitsavers.org/pdf/micromation/Micromation_bios.pdf .
